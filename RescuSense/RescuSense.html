  <h2>Advanced Biomedical Design and Development Project</h2>

<div class="intro">
  <p>
    For my Master of Engineering Program, I worked in a team of three students to develop a medical device from the clinical needs assessment and risk and human factors analysis, to prototyping, regulatory and commercialization strategy. Through a combination of our persistence and passion for our solution we received the Msater's Entrepreneurial Award for our efforts. For an in-depth review of all the work done throughout this year long project, please use the link below. Otherwise, continue down for a general description of the project.

      <br />  Through the first 3 months of this project, I monitored the practices and procedures used to administer care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Boston
      Medical Center. By witnessing the daily care routines and delivery procedures carried out by the staff, I was able to witness a number of opportunities for medical device innovations that could optimize overall care for the patient population.

      <br /> Out of the set of challenges we identified, we worked with our academic advisor to decide on one particular challenge that would be feasible given the time constraints of our 1-year program. The challenge we chose to address was the lack
      of quantitative feedback when resuscitating neonates with bag-valve masks in the first minutes of life. For physicians of various skill-levels and experience, the feedback system for deciding whether or not a neonate can handle the force used to
      squeeze the bag-valve masks is ultimately subjective. Our intent was to provide a quanitifiable measure to help physicians realize their performance with bag-valve masks in real-time.

      With our goal in mind, we began to prototype concept solutions while also regularly meeting with our clinical advisor for user-feedback on our device.

      In addition to prototyping a physical solution, our user-centered design strategy enabled us to consider the multiple stakeholders involved in the care process. To help us remain cognizant of these stakeholders, we used tools like this service map to
      help us understand how our device could affect the work flow in the NICU department.

      With a design concept in mind, we constructed a regulatory strategy around our device, which we named RescuSense! Under the current FDA regulations, and our chosen predicate devices, we intended to classify our device as a FDA Class II device. Alongside
      this, we conceptualized a manufacturing and commercialization strategy as well. For a much more in-depth read on this project, please visit the link below. It leads to the project website and contains our entire design history, business canvas model,
      human factors, and risk analyses on our device.
